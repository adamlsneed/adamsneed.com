        <h1 class="section-title">Built on systems discipline</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          Two decades in enterprise IT — from RedHat and AIX administration through datacenter operations, technical leadership, and deep into identity &amp; access management and security engineering.
        </p>
        <p class="text-textMuted">
          At Netwrix, I&apos;m the subject matter expert on our PAM product — a Senior Solutions Architect in Professional Services focused on identity and access management. I design and deploy enterprise PAM solutions, build automation frameworks, and translate complex security requirements into production-grade implementations. My current fascination is agentic engineering and prompt engineering — I build and operate production multi-agent AI systems with the same rigor I bring to privileged access: least privilege, human-in-the-loop oversight, complete audit trails, and fail-safe defaults.

          My Juris Doctor from LSU Law informs how I design policies, evaluate regulatory risk, and write statement-of-work
